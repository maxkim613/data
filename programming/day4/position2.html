        <p>
            hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
            But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
            I had hoped you'd see my face
            And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
            I wish nothing but the best for you, too
            "Don't forget me, " I beg
            I remember you said
            "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
            "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
