            <p>
                I heard that you're settled down
    That you found a girl and you're married now
    I heard that your dreams came true
    Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
    Old friend, why are you so shy?
    Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
    I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
    But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
    I had hoped you'd see my face
    And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
            </p>
